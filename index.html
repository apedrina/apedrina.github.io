                    I've been working with Java since 2003. My most recent experience has been throguh the development
                    of microservices using Java-8.11.17, SpringBoot, SpringCloud, Docker, GoCD, ArgoCD, GitLab, AWS,
                    Kafka, GitLab, NodeJs and so on. Currently I'm developing microservices at CIELO by Stefanini.

                            Atlantic is a post-purchase system to help Walmart customers open complaints and other
                            issues.
                            The Atlantic have three main parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A frontend implemented with Ruby.</li>
                            <li>A workflow system developed with Ruby.</li>
                            <li>A backend based on microservices developed with Java.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Basically the system keeps some listeners over several queues that are feed by others
                            systems to integrate information
                            about the selling orders also tracking of deliveries, complaint and etc. It system also
                            expose a REST API to integrate
                            with other systems like as: IMS (Inventory), OMS (Order), etc. All flows to process, open,
                            close and other operations
                            over the orders are controlled by a Workflow System/ BPM.

                            Feeds is a project to integrate products and offers for Walmart partners like
                            as google and others.
                            Feeds is a system responsible by generate a file where is put information about all products
                            and offers of the Walmart;
                            then this file is send to our partners. We have one system responsible for all offers, it
                            called GESCOM (an Offer Engine)
                            and other responsible by cataloguing of the products. Beside them we have other systems like
                            as: OMS, IMS, etc. All of
                            them send a message to the Feeds when a product or offer is altered. To attain scalability,
                            high availability and
                            synchronizing all of these systems and keep the file updated we have been built a complex,
                            and well-integrated, group
                            of microservices. We consume services through REST API's.<br>
                            My duties in the Feeds project are maintain it working on production environment and
                            implement new features.

                            Cielo is the biggest credit card company in Brazil. However, they had a poor
                            affiliation system and slower
                            than others players on the market. So, they had created a team to develop a new affiliation
                            system. The team had
                            about more than 50 people involved in it project.
                            I was responsible by the architecture of this project and later became a Technical leader,
                            too. We had to the integrated
                            our system with one system built with SOA using Oracle Suite Buss, BPEL, etc and other
                            system running in Mainframe.
                            We used JSM and WebLogic as the main mechanism of communication between them also we had
                            used spring batch
                            to process files in batch. We built a dashboard to visualize statistics and messages to
                            recovery using Angular2.
                            In this project we used mainly these technologies and tools:
